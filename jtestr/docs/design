TestRunner:

Should have a config file that points out the dir where builds happen. That config file should live in the root of the test directory:
 test/jtestr_config.rb

The config file should also enumerate the jar-files to be added to the class path for this, if that's not done through ant.

classes 'build/classes'
classes ['build/classes', 'build/test']
libraries Dir['lib/**/*.jar']

The default is to find a reasonable place in either ./build or ./target to find classes, and to add all jar-s in ./lib

From there, reasonable defaults will be used,
 meaning files ending in _helper.rb and _factory.rb will always be loaded
 files ending in _spec.rb will be run with RSpec
 everything else will be loaded, and then checked for Test::Unit classes

You can point out directories with the config file, eg:

rspec 'test/dir_name'
dust 'test/other_dir/fluff'
test_unit 'test/a_third_one/

Everything pointed out in the config file will be removed from the automagic finding of stuff.

The order is this:
 first run everything that has unit in the dir name
  then with functional in the dir name
   then with integration in the dir name
    then the rest alphabetically

 within each run, test/unit stuff is run to completion, then specs


You should also be able to point out JUnit classes

junit org.jtestr.tests.MainTestSuite
