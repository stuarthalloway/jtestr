----

Purpose: To make it easier to test Java code with Ruby, than with anything else.
Should include RSpec, Test::Unit, dust, mocha and a few other frameworks
Should include JRuby
Should include custom framework for mixing Java and Ruby testing
Should include some kind of coverage tool (version 2)
Should have reasonable defaults for directory structure so everything works
Maybe code generator to set up the initial structure
Easily create a background server to run tests - it will start up two JRuby instances on startup:
 - testing is asked for, runtime 1 is used for this
 -  testing is finished
 -  runtime 1 gets dumped
 -  runtime 1 gets recreated in the background
 - testing is asked for, while runtime 1 is starting, runtime 2 is used
 - and round

Should be integrated into ANT, Maven, buildr and maybe others. Should be runnable without background server. Should be extremely easy to use:
One line (maybe two) of ant script
One or two lines of maven stuff
etc.

Integration testing stuff?
